# wlp4-Compiler
This is a compiler course project I have done at the University of Waterloo. The compiler is built to convert the programming language WLP4 into MIPS assembly language.
Here's the language specification: https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/wlp4/.
The components of the WLP4 compiler are the following:
* scanner: wlp4scan.cc
* parser: wlp4parse.cc
* type check: wlp4type.cc
* code generator: wlp4gen.cc
